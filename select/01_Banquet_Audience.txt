Werth-Williams

The night was plagued by storms
People came in swarms
Trying to keep warm
All to the house of the Overlord

Through the night they came
Came for food and game
The poor, weak, the lame
All to the house of the Overlord

All through the year they would work and they'd sweat
And wait for the time of the year
Wait for the time when the man from the mansion
Would open his house and appear

Wealthy and regal, inviting the people
To sit at the tables and dine
Drinking their health he would serve them himself
With his music, his food and his wine
