[00:27.35] A heart of stone, a smoking gun
[00:30.22] I can give you life, I can take it away
[00:33.22] A heart of stone, a smoking gun
[00:36.99] I'm working it out, I'm working
[00:52.49] 
[00:45.40] Why'd you feel so underrated?
[00:59.90] 
[00:52.01] Why'd you feel so negated?
[01:05.01] 
[01:05.73] Turning away from the light, becoming adult
[01:12.57] Turning into myself
[01:22.07] 
[01:18.37] I wanted to bite, not destroy, to feel her underneath
[01:25.09] Turning into the light
[01:36.09] 
[01:30.42] She don't think straight
[01:42.42] 
[01:35.59] No, no, no, she don't think straight
[01:53.59] 
[01:43.48] She got such a dirty mind and it never ever stops
[01:46.37] And you don't taste like her and you never ever will
[01:49.44] And we don't read the papers, we don't read the news
[01:52.74] Heaven's never enough, we will never be fooled
[02:15.74] 
[01:57.15] Turning away from the light, becoming adult
[02:04.18] Turning into my soul
[02:09.35] I wanted to bite, not destroy, to feel her underneath
[02:15.10] Turning into the light
[02:26.10] 
[02:23.28] And if you feel (And if you feel)
[02:25.33] A little left behind (A little left behind)
[02:28.66] We will wait for you on the other side
[02:34.81] And if you feel (And if you feel)
[02:38.48] A little left behind (A little left behind)
[02:41.79] We will wait for you on the other side
[03:00.79] 
[02:46.71] 'Cause I'm on fire
[02:49.78] 'Cause you know I'm on fire when you come
[02:52.90] 'Cause you know I'm on fire
[02:56.16] 'Cause you know I'm on fire, so stomp me out
[02:59.54] 'Cause I'm on fire
[03:02.55] 'Cause I'm on fire
[03:05.58] 'Cause I'm on fire
[03:08.87] 'Cause I'm on fire
