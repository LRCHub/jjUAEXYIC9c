I don't want your Apollo of frozen steel
I don't want your lies you teach my children to feel
So keep off my lovers moon or he'll blind thee
As he walks in beauty on water
He didn't need an aeroplane
As we went flying thro' the starry rain
High over rivers of light seas of pearl
High into the sun
Then we spent the night walking on the water
Hey man catch me white bait
Hey man let's have a banquet
Don't wanna know your name
You're just my lover
Just wanna spend the night
Walking beside you on the water
You look like my lover but your words are cold
You say words like him but thinking has made you grow old
So keep off my lovers moon or he'll blind thee
As he walks in beauty on water
